# What is an operator?
# What is the purpose of a comparison operator and what does it do?
# What does the ‘<’ operator do?
# What does the ‘==’ operator do?
# What does the ‘!=’ operator do?
# Try running the following bits of code:
# What does ‘10 < 30’ return?
# What does ‘30 < 20’ return?
# What does ‘20 <= 20’ return?
# What does ‘20 != 29’ return?
# What does the ‘if’ check do?
# Copy the following code to a file and run:
# if 10 < 20:
#    print("Ten is less than 20!")
# else:
#    print("Ten is not less than 20!")
#  Try running the following guessing game code:
# number = 23
# guess = int(input('Enter an integer : '))
 
# if guess == number:
#     # New block starts here
#     print('Congratulations, you guessed it.')
#     print('(but you do not win any prizes!)')
#     # New block ends here
# elif guess < number:
#     # Another block
#     print('No, it is a little higher than that')
#     # You can do whatever you want in a block ...
# else:
#     print('No, it is a little lower than that')
#     # you must have guessed > number to reach here
 
# print('Done')
# # This last statement is always executed,
# # after the if statement is executed.
