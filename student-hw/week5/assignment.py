# What is the purpose of a comparison operator and what does it do?
#   A: The comparison operator allows you to compare two objects. It could be two strings, two values, as well as other complex types.
# What does the ‘<’ operator do?
#   A: Performs a 'less than' evaluation checking to see if the left operand is smaller than the right.
# What does the ‘==’ operator do?
#   A: Performs a 'equal to' comparison checking to see if the left and right operands are binary equal.
# What does the ‘!=’ operator do?
#   A: Performs a 'not equal to' comparison, checking if the left and right operands are not equal to each other.
# Try running the following bits of code:
# What does ‘10 < 30’ return?
#   A: True
# What does ‘30 < 20’ return?
#   A: False
# What does ‘20 <= 20’ return?
#   A: True
# What does ‘20 != 29’ return?
#   A: True
# What does the ‘if’ check do?
#   A: performs a boolean check on an expression.
