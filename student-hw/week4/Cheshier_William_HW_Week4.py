# 2a:Yes, a string is called a string.
#2b:You can make strings by enclosing it in either single or double quotation marks.
#2c: name = "Chris"
# print(name)---returns Chris
#2d:pi = 3.14
# print("The value of pi is " + str(pi))---The value of pi is 3.14
#2e: The string copies the variable for pi and adds it to the print function in that scenario.

#3: str.lower() changes the characters of a word in lowercase.

#4: str.find() finds that ceratin word or character(s) in a given area of code.

#5: No, strings aren't arrays.

#6: The index value prints only the integers that are in the code.

#7: Slicing means taking a certain number of characters from a word.
#7a:  s = "Hello"
#(i) print(s[1:4])---ell
#(ii) print(s[0:3])---Hel
#(iii) print(s[:])---Hello

#8: help(int)---you can convert a number or string into an integer

#9: help(str)---if x isn't a number or if the base is given, then it is a string

#10: s = 3
# print(s)---it returns 3
# print(int(s))---it returns 3 too. The 'int' makes sure it is an integer.

#11: s = 3.14
# print(s)---returns 3.14
# print(s(int))---returns as a float
# print(float(s))---returns 3.14
