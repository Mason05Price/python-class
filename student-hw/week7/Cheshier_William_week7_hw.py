#3: A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items.

#4: {'turkey', 'chicken', 'bacon', 'sausage'}

#5: Many different types of data.

# #6: my_list = ['a', 3, [2, 1], "hello"]
# print(my_list[0])
# print(my_list[1])
# print(my_list[2])
# print(my_list[3])---returns a 3 [2,1] hello

# #7: my_list = ['a', 3, [2, 1], "hello"]
# print(type(my_list[0]))
# print(type(my_list[1]))
# print(type(my_list[2]))
# print(type(my_list[3]))---returns <class 'str'> <class 'int'> <class 'list'> <class 'str'>

#8: Tuples are ordered collections of data.

#9: No, you cannot change its values.

# #10: my_tuple = ("hello", "world")
# my_tuple[0] = "new string!"---returns as an error because you cannot change tuple values once they have been assigned.

#11: A dictionary is an unordered collection of values.
#11 a: A key is a set that is used to identify records in table.
#11 b: A value returns as a "view object"

# #12: my_dictionary = {"chris": 36, "bob": 27}
# print(my_dictionary["chris"])---returns 36

# #13: my_dictionary = {"chris": 36, "bob": 27}
# print(my_dictionary[36])---it returns as a "key error"

#14: shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']---does not have an output because we are only assigning a value, not printing anything.
