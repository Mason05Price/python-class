#3: The 'else' statement initiates code based on the response recieved from the last command.

#4: The "elif" statement is used if you want code initiated based off the command of the previous "else" statement.

#5: The "while" evaluates code against Boolean, and if it is true it continues.

# #6: number = 22
# if number > 22:
#     print("A")
# elif number == 23:
#     print("B")
# elif number >= 22:
#     print("C")---"C" is printed

# #7: loops = 20
# number_loops = 1
# while loops != 0:
#     if loops % 2 == 0:
#         loops = loops - 2
#     print (number_loops)
#     number_loops += 1---It will loop 10 times.

#8: The "while" keyword starts a while loop.

# #9: for i in range(1, 5):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print('The for loop is over')---Returns 1, 2, 3, 4, The loop is over.

#10: The "for" keyword starts a for loop.

#11: The "range" function returns numbers before stopping before the specified one.
 
#12: The "break" statement breaks out of a loop.

#13: The "continue" statement tells Python to continue past the rest of the code in this loop and move on to the next statement.

# #14: for i in range(1, 100):
#     print(i)
#     if i > 10:
#         break---It will loop 11 times, then break.
