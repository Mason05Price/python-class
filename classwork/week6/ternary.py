# Python ternary operations
# Help reduce code size and make it easier to read simple conditionals

# Example of basic if check
# a = 2
# b = 3
# if a > b:
#     print("a")
# else:
#     print("b")

# # Lets rewrite this using a ternary operator format
# # Syntax:   [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]
# print ("a" if a > b else "b")

# NOTE: Python does not have a ternary "Operator" like C++ (:). 
# But it can perform ternary logical operations
