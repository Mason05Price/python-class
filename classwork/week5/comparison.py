# Python comparison operators 
#   less than <
#   less than or equal <=
#   greater than >
#   greater than or equal >=
#   equal to ==
#   not equal to !=

# Comparison operators compares a left operand (left side of the equation) to the right operand (right side of the equation).
# The result is always a boolean (true/false) result

# A boolean type is a data type which can only represent two values true (1) or false (0). This is the most basic data type.
# All computer programing is born from the idea of On/off, true/false. A bit is either enabled (1) or disabled (0). 
# The first computer ever created physically open and closed "gates" to perform basic computation.

# The boolean type
# print(type(bool))
# print((True))
# print((False))
# print(bool.bit_count(True))
# print(bool.bit_count(False))

# Less than operator <
# print(3 < 5)
# print(9 < 5)
# print("9 < 5")

# Less than or equal operator <=
# print(3 <= 5)
# print(9 <= 5)
# print(9 <= 9)

# Greater than operator <
# print(3 > 5)
# print(9 > 5)
# print(9 > 9)

# Greater than or equal to operator <=
# print(3 >= 5)
# print(9 >= 5)
# print(9 >= 9)

# Equal to operator ==
# print(3 == 5)
# print(9 == 5)
# print(9 == 9)

# Not equal to operator !=
# print(3 != 5)
# print(9 != 5)
# print(9 != 9)
